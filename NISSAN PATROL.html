    <div class="history">
        <p><b>The Nissan Patrol, a robust and versatile off-road vehicle, has a rich history spanning over seven decades.
        Introduced in 1951, the Patrol was Nissan's answer to the demand for durable 4WD vehicles,
         akin to the American Jeep and the British Land Rover. Over the years, it has evolved through multiple generations,
          earning a reputation for reliability, strength, and off-road prowess.<br></b></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3><b>First Generation (1951-1960)</b></h3>
    <div class="first">

<div class="parafirst"><p><b>In September 1951, the 4W60 was introduced exclusively to Japanese Nissan dealerships.
     The overall styling was similar to the Willys Jeep. 
     The 4W60 used the 75 PS (55 kW) 3.7 L Nissan NAK engine from the Nissan 290 bus, 
     but with part-time four-wheel drive and a four-speed manual transmission. 
     The grille had a pressed-steel Nissan badge. A 4W70 Carrier-based wagon was available.
    The 4W61 was introduced in August 1955; it changed the grille (with some chrome bars),
     a one-piece windshield that sits further back when folded, chrome strips on the hood,
      and unequally sized seats (passenger's side is wider than the driver's).
       The other big change was the engine. The 4W61 was powered by the new 3.7 L Nissan NB engine,
        producing 92 PS (68 kW), and later was powered by the 105 PS (77 kW) 4.0 L Nissan NC engine.
         The grille badge was chrome and red and said "NISSAN".
    In October 1958, the 4W65 Patrol replaced the 4W61.
     The 4W65 changed the grille, which now had all chrome bars and redesigned front fenders and hood.
      A "NISSAN" badge was on the grille and "Patrol" badges were added on the sides of the hood.
       An eight-seater hardtop wagon, the WG4W65, was added. The short-lived 4W66 Patrol was introduced in December 1956,
        powered by the 125 PS (92 kW) 4.0 L P engine. The 4W66 was discontinued in June 1960. A wagon version of the 4W66
         was called the Carrier, from 1956 to 1959.</b></p></div>

        <p>The soft-top Nissan Patrol 60 and G60 were first sold in Australia in 1960. 
            Left-hand drive L60/GL60 models were sold outside of Australia. <br>
             <br>
             The 4WD Nissan Patrol 60 series was produced in short, medium, and long wheelbase versions.
              It had a manual transmission type-F3B83L at first with three and later with four speeds,
               and a two-speed transfer case with part-time four-wheel drive. The motor was the P engine, 
               a 3,956 cc inline overhead-valve six-cylinder, featuring bathtub-shaped combustion chambers and
                a fully balanced seven-bearing crank shaft. With two doors in front and one at the back and four seats 
                , the extra-long wheelbase version was available with eight-passenger capacity. <br>
                 <br>
                  <b>JONGA</b>
                  <br>
                  Beginning around 1969, the Indian Army's Vehicle Factory Jabalpur began assembling the quarter-ton Nissan Patrol as the Jonga,
                   along with the Nissan 4W73. The name as per Indian army records is an acronym for Jabalpur Ordinance aNd Guncarriage Assembly.
                    Both the Nissan vehicles were fitted with the same engines and shared many parts. The Jonga was briefly sold to civilian customers 
                    with a 4.0-litre Hino diesel engine in 1996, but demand was low, due to an uncompetitive price, as well as unappealing looks. 
                    Less than 200 units were sold. The Jonga served faithfully until the late 1990s, when it was replaced by the lighter Mahindra and Mahindra MM550.
                     Auctioned ex-Army Jongas, stretched and converted to people carriers, still serve in some rural areas of India.

        <p>The Nissan Patrol Y60, introduced in 1987, is one of the most iconic models in the Patrol lineup,
             known for its exceptional off-road capabilities and rugged construction. This generation marked a significant
              evolution from its predecessors with numerous advancements that cemented its status among 4x4 enthusiasts and 
              professionals alike. <br>
              <br>
              The Y60 series brought a more modern and robust design compared to earlier models. It featured a boxy, 
              utilitarian exterior that emphasized its off-road prowess. One of the most notable design changes was 
              the introduction of coil spring suspension on all four wheels, replacing the leaf springs used in previous
               models. This upgrade significantly improved ride comfort and off-road performance, allowing for better 
               articulation and smoother handling over rough terrain. <br>
               <br>
               The TD42 diesel engine, in particular, became famous for its reliability and longevity, making it a preferred choice for
                off-road enthusiasts. The inclusion of turbocharged variants, such as the TD42T, further enhanced the vehicle's
                 performance, providing more power and torque for demanding conditions. <br>
                 <br>
                 The Y60 Patrol is still highly regarded in the 4x4 community for its durability, ease of maintenance, 
                 and exceptional off-road capabilities. It is often modified for extreme off-roading and overlanding, 
                 thanks to its strong aftermarket support. Even decades after its release, the Y60 remains a popular 
                 choice for enthusiasts seeking a reliable and capable off-road vehicle.
                 In summary, the Nissan Patrol Y60 stands out as a pivotal model in the Patrol lineage, 
                 combining rugged construction with improved comfort and advanced off-road features.
                  Its legacy continues to influence the design and performance of modern 4x4 vehicles.

                 spring suspension, which provided excellent wheel articulation and durability. Advanced off-road 
                 technologies included: All-Mode 4x4 System: Allowed drivers to switch between 2WD, 4WD High,
                  and 4WD Low modes, adapting to various terrains and driving conditions. Differential Locks:
