<div class="history">
    <p><b>The first generation Z was introduced in 1969 as a 1970 model. Known as Datsun 240Z, the model was introduced to compete
         with the likes of Toyota’s 2000 GT sports car. The two-door, two-seat sports car came with a rear drive.
        The 2.4-litre engine with a 6-speed transmission was able to produce 151 horsepower and had a maximum speed of about
         201 kilometres per hour. Production of 240Z stopped in 1973 and 260Z was introduced in 1974.
        For the new model, a 2.6-litre engine was used and horsepower was increased to 165. The exterior also received an upgrade
         with new tail lights, a longer wheelbase and a larger bumper. The Nissan Z history also saw the introduction of Bosch 
         electronic fuel injection. The 260Z was available in both long and short wheelbases.<br></b></p>

    <p><b>In 1979, the second generation Nissan Z was introduced. The new 280ZX was more of a grand touring vehicle than a sports car.
         The new model was larger compared to the predecessors and more luxuriously appointed. Taller gearing and more weight in the
          2+2 variant affected the model’s acceleration. <br>
          <br>
        The new model was available in a T-Top style roof. In 1981, a turbo variant was introduced which tackled the acceleration issue.
         The 2.8-litre turbo engine could produce 180 horsepower and about 275 NM torque. The turbo engine also enabled the vehicle to
          reach from 0 to about 100 kilometres per hour in an impressive 7.4 seconds.</b></p></div>

    <p>The Nissan Z history saw the introduction of the third generation model in 1984. Nissan focused heavily on aesthetics with a less
         curvaceous body design and a more aerodynamic nose. Additionally, the model was available in two seats and a 2+2 configuration.
        The introduction of the V6 engine was another highlight of the third generation. The transmission options included a 5-speed manual
         or a four-speed automatic transmission. The third generation also modernised the Nissan Z with an optional computerised vocal 
         alert system.
        For the third generation, a special 50th-anniversary special edition was also introduced. Available in two-tone silver and black,
         the special edition had adjustable dampers, unique leather seats and a digitally styled dashboard.</p>

        The fifth generation model was available in 5-speed automatic and 6-speed manual transmissions. The new model was available

    <p>The sixth generation of Nissan Z was somewhat similar to the previous generations but this time Nissan used lightweight
         materials. The V6 engine was able to produce 332 horsepower and about 366 NM torque.
        A 40th-anniversary special edition was also introduced for celebrating the models’ legacy. Some of the major highlights
         of the special edition included:
        
        Front and rear spoilers <br>
        <br>
        Sports brakes including red callipers <br>

    <p>After running for over a decade, Nissan retired the 370Z and in its place came the Nissan Z. The seventh-generation Nissan Z
         surpasses its predecessors by a margin in terms of performance and looks.
        The seventh generation has a luxurious interior and exterior and an enhanced infotainment system. The seventh generation is
         available for purchase for buyers.
        This was everything about the Nissan Z history. The popularity of the sports car has seen the introduction of seven generations
         and the model has received major upgrades with each model. The Nissan Z generations remain a popular choice among the brand’s 
         fans and we can expect to see more advancements in the later models.</p>
