          and VG30E V6. The S12 was badged as a Silvia in Japan, Europe, and Australia, and as a 200SX in North America. In Japan, the S12 
          was available in base, RS, and RS-X trims, while in North America, it was available in XE, Turbo, and SE trims. The European S12 
          was equipped with the CA18ET or FJ20E engine. The Australian Gazelle was equipped with the CA20E engine. The S12 was revised in 
          1986, with updated bumpers and increased rubstripping.</p>

    <p>The S14 Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of 1993. It was lower and wider than the S13. New rounded styling
         contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size than actually occurred. Wheelbase and track were both increased,
          leading to slightly improved handling. Unlike export markets, where sales of the S14 chassis variants faltered,
           the Silvia remained popular in Japan. <br>
           <br>
           The Nissan Silvia S14 has a strong following in the automotive community, particularly in drifting and tuning circles.
            Its balance of performance and customization potential makes it a favorite among enthusiasts. <br>
            <br>
            The S14 continued to build on the success of the S13, cementing the Silvia's reputation as a versatile and performance-oriented
             sports car. It remains a popular choice among car enthusiasts for its combination of style, performance, and modifiability.
