<div class="history">
    <p><b>Nissan as we know it began in 1928 when founder Yoshisuke Aikawa became president of Nihon Sangyo.
         The company primarily dealt with foundries and auto parts and debuted on the Tokyo stock exchange as NISSAN in 1933.
          For many, many years,Nissan produced their vehicles under the Datsun nameplate; the Datsun Type 15 was the first mass-produced
             Japanese vehicle. After WWII, Nissan produced popular vehicles around the world including the Nissan Skyline,
              Datsun 1200 Sedan, and the original 1959 Datsun compact pickup. Though already popular in Europe and Japan,
               Nissan didn’t debut to the American market until 1959.
