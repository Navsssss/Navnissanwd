    <p>The Skyline name originated from Prince automobile company, which developed and sold the Skyline line of sedans
        before merging with Nissan-Datsun. The original Skyline was launched by the Prince Motor Company in April 1957
         and was powered by a 1.5-litre engine. The later iteration launched in 1964 called the Prince Skyline GT was 
         powered by a 2.0-litre G7 inline-6 engine shared with the up market Prince Gloria sedan. <br>
        <br>
        The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Turismo Racing while the GT-B stands for Gran Turismo Berlinetta.
         The Japanese chose to use Italian naming conventions when naming the car as most cars that were made
          in Japan at that time used Western abbreviations to further enhance sales. The earliest predecessor 
          of the GT-R, the S54 2000 GT-B, came second in its first race in the 1964 Japanese GP to the purpose-built
           Porsche 904 GTS. However, the earlier Prince Skyline Sport coupé/convertible foreshadowed the GT-R as the
            first sports-oriented model in the Skyline range, hence the name. <br>
            <br>
            The Skyline continued into the 1990s when it became popular largely because it remained rear wheel drive,
             while most other manufacturers were focusing on front wheel drive cars. Throughout its lifetime, various
              special editions containing additional performance-enhancing modifications were introduced by Nissan and 
              its performance division Nismo (Nissan Motorsport).

<div class="history">
    <p><b>The first Skyline GT-R, known by the internal Nissan designation of PGC10, was introduced on 4 February 1969,
         and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Store when the Prince company was 
         integrated into Nissan operations in 1966. It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut
          at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show. It was advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline's
           racing heraldry. It was equipped with the 2.0 L DOHC S20 Inline-six engine rated at 119 kW (162 PS; 160 hp) at
            7,000 rpm and 176 N⋅m (130 lb⋅ft) at 5,600 rpm.[14] Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual 
            transmission and the car was equipped with a limited slip differential. The first Skyline GT-R rode on a semi-trailing
             arm strut suspension. The braking system consisted of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear.
              It was available in a coupé bodystyle in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10.<br></b></p>

<div class="parafirst">
    <p>The R31 Skyline introduced many new technologies and features. The HR31 was the first Skyline to be equipped
         with the new RB-series of engines. The HR31 RB engines are often referred to as "Red Top" engines because 
         of the red cam covers. There were three variants. The earliest series of DOHC, 24-valve, RB engines used the NICS 
         (Nissan Induction Control System) injection system with 12 very small intake runners, and a butterfly system to 
         divide the intake ports in half for better low RPM performance. <br>
         <br>
         The ultimate version of the R31 was the RB20DET-R powered HR31 GTS-R Coupe of which 823 units were built to allow
          an homologation "evolution" mode for Group A Touring Car racing. Introduced in late 1987, it had a reworked version
           of the normal RB20DET with a much larger turbocharger on a tubular steel exhaust manifold, as well as a much larger
            front-mounted intercooler. It had a factory-claimed maximum output of 210 PS, with racing versions making over 430 hp
             (321 kW; 436 PS) in Group A trim, though this was still at least 110 hp  less than the leading Group A car of the time,
              the Ford Sierra RS500 (which had approximately the same weight as the Nissan), and around 70 hp less than the heavier
               (by around 225 kg (496 lb)) V8 Holden Commodore. Jim Richards and Mark Skaife drove a Gibson Motor Sport prepared
                Skyline GTS-R to win the 1989 Sandown 500 in Australia. Richards also used the GTS-R in 6 of the 8 races to win 
                the 1990 Australian Touring Car Championship (he used the R32 GT-R in the final two rounds of the series).
                 It was the first Australian Touring Car Championship victory for a Nissan driver after George Fury placed 
                 second in 1983 and 1986 and Glenn Seton gained second position in 1987.

<div class="w70p">
    <p>The R32 Skyline debuted in 1989. It was available as either a 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan,
         all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines. <br>
        <br>
        The R32 GT-R dominated Japanese Touring Car Championship , winning 29 races from 29 starts, taking the series
         title every year from 1989 to 1993. It took 50 races from 50 starts from 1991 to 1997  in the N1 Super Taikyu. 
         <br>
         <br>
         The R32 GT-R was introduced into the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1990 and promptly ended the reign 
         of the previously all-conquering Ford Sierra Cosworth, winning Bathurst 1000 classic in 1991 and 1992. 
         This success led to the Australian motoring press nicknaming the car Godzilla due to it being a "monster from Japan".
          As Australia was the first export market for the car the name quickly spread. Such was the GT-R's dominance that it was
           a significant factor in the demise of Group A Touring Car racing, the formula being scrapped soon after.
            JTCC was similarly blighted by the R32 GT-R, and splintered soon after, leading to the switch to the Supertouring 
            category and also indirectly to the GT500 category of today.

<div class="Ypara">
    <p>The R33 Skyline was introduced in August 1993. Slightly heavier than the R32, it was again available in coupé and sedan body
         configurations. The R33 was the safest of the models with a rating of 3.8 out of 5.5 accordingly; the airbag system and 
         internal crash bars made this vehicle significantly safer than previous models. All models now used a six-cylinder engine.
          Nissan took the unusual step of down-grading the GTS model to have only the RB20E, this was mated to either a 5 speed manual
           or a optional 5 speed automatic. The twin-cam unit of the R32 GTS was discontinued and so was the 2.0 L turbo RB20DET from
            the GTS-t, this was replaced with the GTS-25t which was equipped with the larger RB25DET and mated to either a 5 speed manual
             or a optional 4 speed automatic, the 5 speed auto was not used as it wasn’t strong enough for the extra power. 
             HICAS was standard in all GTS-25t sub-models except the Type G.
        The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) continued the concepts introduced in the R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996.
         As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they do not meet
          the frontal impact standards. For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer 
          located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's
           turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response.

        The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor.
         The valve covers were painted glossy red, as opposed to black in previous models. <br>
        <br>The legacy of the R34 GT-R is marked by its blend of advanced technology, performance, and cultural impact.

    <p>The Nissan GT-R is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered
         both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the
          Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear
           the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the
            FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's 
            Tochigi plant in Japan. <br>
        <br>
        It took engineers and designers more than six years to complete the overall development of the car. After finalizing development
        in 2006, an additional year was dedicated for testing before reaching the conclusive stage. Nissan officially announced that 
        the production version would make its debut at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Ghosn was confident in the GT-R's potential profitability
        for Nissan, and dispelled the rumours of it being sold as an Infiniti model in North America, confirming its global release as a 
        Nissan model. <br>
        <br>
        The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as confirmed, following an on-screen 7:38.54 minute 
        lap time in damp conditions around the Nürburgring Nordschleife was broadcast, beating the benchmark Porsche 911 Turbo's time of 
        7:40 minutes. Nissan called it the record for the fastest lap time for a mass-produced car. The car was previewed as "A supercar,
         for Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime".[7] In November, 2007, Nissan revealed that the car already had a considerable demand, 
         as more than 3,000 buyers pre-ordered the car in Japan before its official launch. The car was expected to sell around 
         200 units per month, to maintain exclusivity.[22] Deliveries began on December 6, 2007, in Japan, on July 7, 2008, 
         in North America and in March 2009 in Europe. The first production GT-R was purchased by Nissan's CEO at the time, Carlos Ghosn.
          The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases was due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance 
          centres where the car was serviced.
